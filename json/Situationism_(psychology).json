Andrew Colman,\nWhat is Psychology?,\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=fqGxFGY0DkMC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98 p.98] It\nrefers to an approach to personality that holds that people are more influenced\nby external, situational factors than by internal traits or motivations. It\ntherefore challenges the position of trait theorists, such as Hans Eysenck or\nRaymond B. Cattell.\n\nSituationists base their claims on experiments that measure traits such as\nextraversion in different situations. They found that a particular person's\nscores in one situation did not predict that person's score in another situation\nwell. However, in response to such evidence, Hans Eysenck has pointed out that\nthe correlations, while low, are typically still high enough to reach\nstatistical significance. A midrange position, which holds that personality is\nbest understood as resulting from subtle interplay of internal and external\nfactors, is known as \"interactionism\".\n\nSome notable situationist studies include: Zimbardo's Stanford prison\nexperiment, bystander experiments, obedience experiments like Milgram experiment\nand Heat and aggression experiments. The term is popularly associated with\nWalter Mischel, although he himself does not appear to like the term.\n","linknr":103,"url":"Situationism_(psychology)","recorded":1362684331,"links":17,"instances":["human_behavior"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Personality theories"],"headings":["Notes","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/30px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["obedience","human_behavior"]],"members":["obedience"],"related":["Psychology","Trait_theory","Motivation","Hans_Eysenck","Raymond_B._Cattell","Extraversion","Statistical_significance","Interactionism","Philip_Zimbardo","Stanford_prison_experiment","Bystander_effect","Obedience_(human_behavior)","Milgram_experiment","Aggression","Walter_Mischel"]}
