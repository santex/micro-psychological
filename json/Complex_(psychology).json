{"cursor":"11626","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":For alternate usage, see [[complexity]].\n\n\nA 'complex' is a core pattern of emotions, memories, perceptions, and wishes in\nthe personal unconscious organized around a common theme, such as power or\nstatus (Schultz, D. & Schultz, S., 2009). Primarily a psychoanalytic term, it is\nfound extensively in the works of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud.\n\nAn example of a complex would be as follows: if you had a leg amputated when you\nwere a child, this would influence your life in profound ways, even if you were\nwonderfully successful in overcoming the handicap. You might have many thoughts,\nemotions, memories, feelings of inferiority, triumphs, bitterness and\ndeterminations centering on that one aspect of your life. If these thoughts\ntroubled you, Jung would say you had a complex about the leg (Dewey, 2007).\n\nComplex existence is widely agreed upon in the area of depth psychology. It\nassumes the most important factors influencing your personality are deep in the\nunconscious (Dewey, 2007). They are generally a way of mapping the psyche, and\nare crucial theoretical items of common reference to be found in therapy.\nComplexes are believed by Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud to influence the\nindividual's attitude and behavior.\n","linknr":302,"url":"Complex_(psychology)","recorded":1362372534,"links":47,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychoanalytic terminology","Jungian psychology","Complex (psychology)","Freudian psychology"],"headings":["History and development of the idea","Jung's theory of complexes with key citations","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Emotion","Psychoanalysis","Carl_Jung","Sigmund_Freud","Depth_psychology","Unconscious_mind","Collective_unconscious","Instinct","Theodor_Ziehen","Word_association","Burgh√∂lzli","Zurich_University","Sir_Francis_Galton","Archetype","Anima_and_animus","Anima_and_animus","Oedipus_complex","Child_Development","Electra_complex","Neurosis","Francis_Galton","Anima_and_animus","Freudian_psychology","Jungian_psychology","Father_complex","Hero_complex","Inferiority_complex","Napoleon_complex","Superiority_complex"]}
