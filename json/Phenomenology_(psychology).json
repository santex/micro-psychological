Giorgi,\nAmedeo. (1970). Psychology as a Human Science. New York : Harper & Row.\nEarly phenomenologists such as Husserl, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-\nPonty conducted philosophical investigations of consciousness in the early 20th\ncentury. Their critiques of psychologism and positivism later influenced at\nleast two main fields of contemporary psychology: the phenomenological\npsychological approach of the Duquesne School (The Descriptive Phenomenological\nMethod in Psychology), including Amedeo Giorgi Giorgi, Amedeo. (2009). The Descriptive Phenomenological Method\nin Psychology. Duquesne University Press: Pittsburgh, PA. and Frederick\nWertz; and the experimental approaches associated with Francisco Varela, Shaun\nGallagher, Evan Thompson, and others (embodied mind thesis). Other names\nassociated with the movement include Jonathan Smith (Interpretative\nPhenomenological Analysis), Steinar Kvale, and Wolfgang KÃ¶hler. Phenomenological\npsychologists have also figured prominently in the history of the humanistic\npsychology movement.\n\nThe experiencing subject can be considered to be the person or self, for\npurposes of convenience. In phenomenological philosophy (and in particular in\nthe work of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty), \"experience\" is a\nconsiderably more complex concept than it is usually taken to be in everyday\nuse. Instead, experience (or being, or existence itself) is an \"in-relation-to\"\nphenomenon, and it is defined by qualities of directedness, embodiment, and\nworldliness, which are evoked by the term \"Being-in-the-World\". Langdridge, D. (2006). Phenomenological psychology:\ntheory, research and method. Harlow: Pearson.\n\nThe quality or nature of a given experience is often referred to by the term\nqualia, whose archetypical exemplar is \"redness\". For example, we might ask, \"Is\nmy experience of redness the same as yours?\" While it is difficult to answer\nsuch a question in any concrete way, the concept of intersubjectivity is often\nused as a mechanism for understanding how it is that humans are able to\nempathise with one another's experiences, and indeed to engage in meaningful\ncommunication about them. The phenomenological formulation of Being-in-the-\nWorld, where person and world are mutually constitutive, is central here.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Phenomenology_(psychology)","recorded":1362373668,"links":16,"instances":["psychologist","psychology","psychology","philosophy"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Branches of psychology","Phenomenology"],"headings":["Difficulties in considering subjective phenomena","Psychotherapy and the phenomenology of emotion","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phenomenology","philosophy"],["jonathan_smith","psychologist"],["self","psychology"],["phenomenology","philosophy"],["stream_of_consciousness","psychology"]],"members":["jonathan_smith","self","stream_of_consciousness","phenomenology"],"related":["Phenomenology_(philosophy)","Edmund_Husserl","Amedeo_Giorgi","Husserl","Jean-Paul_Sartre","Maurice_Merleau-Ponty","Duquesne_School","Descriptive_Phenomenological_Method_in_Psychology","Amedeo_Giorgi","Amedeo_Giorgi","Frederick_Wertz","Francisco_Varela","Shaun_Gallagher","Evan_Thompson","Embodied_cognition","Jonathan_Smith_(psychologist)","Interpretative_Phenomenological_Analysis","Steinar_Kvale","Wolfgang_Köhler","Humanistic_psychology","Person","Self_(psychology)","Phenomenology_(philosophy)","Philosophy","Edmund_Husserl","Heidegger","Merleau-Ponty","Qualia","Intersubjectivity","Introspection","William_James","Edward_Thorndike","Clark_Hull","John_B._Watson","B._F._Skinner","Francisco_Varela","Phenomenological_reduction","Qualia","Feeling","Effort","Carl_Rogers","Person-centered_psychotherapy","Phenomenal_field","Stream_of_consciousness_(psychology)","Associationism","Association_of_Ideas","Ideology","Prejudice"]}
