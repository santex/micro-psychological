Salman Akhtar, Comprehensive\nDictionary of Psychoanalysis (London 2009) p. 112 Subsequently '\"Fixation\"\nacquired a broader connotation. With the development of theory of libidinal\nstages...the term came to mean a persistent attachment, not only to the specific\ninstinctual aims of a particular era, but, instead, to the entire complex of\nself and object relation' Akhtar, p. 112 at that time.\n\nMore generally, it is the state in which an individual becomes obsessed with an\nattachment to another person, being or object (in human psychology): 'A strong\nattachment to a person or thing, especially such an attachment formed in\nchildhood or infancy and manifested in immature or neurotic behavior that\npersists throughout life'.
