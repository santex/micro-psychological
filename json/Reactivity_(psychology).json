{"cursor":"1993","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Reactivity}}\n\n\n\n'Reactivity' is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals alter their\nperformance or behavior due to the awareness that they are being observed.\n{{cite book |title=Research Design in Counseling |author=Heppner, P.P., Wampold,\nB.E., & Kivlighan, D.M. |year=2008 |edition=3rd ed. |publisher=Thomson\n|pages=331 }} The change may be positive or negative, and depends on the\nsituation. It is a significant threat to a research study's internal validity\nand is typically controlled for using blind experiment designs.\n\nThere are several forms of reactivity. The Hawthorne effect occurs when\nresearch study participants know they are being studied and alter their\nperformance because of the attention they receive from the experimenters. The\nJohn Henry effect, a specific form of Hawthorne effect, occurs when the\nparticipants in the control group alter their behavior out of awareness that\nthey are in the control group.\n\nReactivity is not limited to changes in behaviour in relation to being merely\nobserved; it can also refer to situations where individuals alter their behavior\nto conform to the expectations of the observer. An experimenter effect occurs\nwhen the experimenters subtly communicate their expectations to the\nparticipants, who alter their behavior to conform to these expectations. The\nPygmalion effect occurs when students alter their behavior to meet teacher\nexpectations. Both experimenter effects and Pygmalion effects can be caused by\nbias and stereotyping, as demonstrated by studies involving stereotype threat.\n","linknr":149,"url":"Reactivity_(psychology)","recorded":1362572851,"links":19,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Experimental psychology","Performance psychology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/40px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/16px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Internal_validity","Experimental_control","Blind_experiment","Hawthorne_effect","John_Henry_effect","Experimenter_effect","Pygmalion_effect","Bias","Stereotyping","Stereotype_threat","Bradley_effect","Demand_characteristics","Observer-expectancy_effect","Social_desirability_bias"]}
