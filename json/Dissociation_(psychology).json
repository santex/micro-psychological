{"cursor":"22511","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Dissociation' is a term in psychology describing a wide array of experiences\nfrom mild detachment from immediate surroundings to more severe detachment from\nphysical and emotional experience. It is commonly displayed on a continuum. The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena\ninvolves a detachment from reality – rather than a loss of reality as in\npsychosis. In mild cases,\ndissociation can be regarded as a coping mechanism or defense mechanisms in\nseeking to master, minimize or tolerate stress – including boredom or\nconflict. At the nonpathological\nend of the continuum, dissociation describes common events such as daydreaming\nwhile driving a vehicle. Further along the continuum are non-pathological\naltered states of consciousness.\n\nMore pathological dissociation involves dissociative disorders, including\ndissociative fugue and depersonalization disorder with or without alterations in\npersonal identity or sense of self. These alterations can include: a sense that\nself or the world is unreal (derealization and depersonalization); a loss of\nmemory (amnesia); forgetting identity or assuming a new self (fugue); and\nfragmentation of identity or self into separate streams of consciousness\n(dissociative identity disorder, formerly termed multiple personality disorder)\nand complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Dissociative\ndisorders are sometimes triggered by trauma, but may be preceded only by stress,\npsychoactive substances, or no identifiable trigger at all. The ICD-\n10 classifies conversion disorder as a dissociative disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\ngroups all dissociative disorders into a single category.\n\nAlthough some dissociative disruptions involve amnesia, other dissociative\nevents do not. Dissociative disorders are typically experienced as\nstartling, autonomous intrusions into the person's usual ways of responding or\nfunctioning. Due to their unexpected and largely inexplicable nature, they tend\nto be quite unsettling.\n","linknr":474,"url":"Dissociation_(psychology)","recorded":1362543102,"links":36,"instances":["biological","psychology","psychologist","tests","psychology","measurement","tests","psychology"],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20080414011336/http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf","http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20080414011336/http://www.psych.umn.edu/faculty/waller/classes/mult06/taxometrics/wallerputnam.pdf","http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf","http://www.johnbriere.com/methodological%20csa%20jccp%201992.pdf"],"categories":["Abnormal psychology","Dissociative disorders","Defence mechanisms"],"headings":["History","Measurement and diagnosis of dissociative disorder","Relation to trauma and abuse","Psychoactive substances","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf7/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["continuum","measurement"],["coping","psychology"],["stress","biology"],["stress","biological"],["william_mcdougall","psychologist"],["attitude","psychology"],["specificity","tests"],["sensitivity","tests"],["coping","psychology"],["splitting","psychology"]],"members":["stress","splitting","william_mcdougall","specificity","attitude","continuum","sensitivity","coping"],"related":["Psychology","Continuum_(measurement)","Psychosis","Coping_(psychology)","Defense_mechanism","Stress_(biology)","Emotional_conflict","Daydreaming","Altered_states_of_consciousness","Dissociative_disorder","Dissociative_fugue","Depersonalization_disorder","Derealization","Depersonalization","Amnesia","Dissociative_identity_disorder","Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder","ICD-10","Conversion_disorder","Dissociative_disorder","Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders","French_people","Psychiatrist","Pierre_Janet","Defense_mechanism","Psychoanalysis","Hysteria","Stress_(biological)","Case_study","William_James","Boris_Sidis","Morton_Prince","William_McDougall_(psychologist)","Ernest_Hilgard","Carl_Jung","Attitude_(psychology)","Post-traumatic_stress_disorder","Dissociative_identity_disorder","Multiple_personality_controversy","Neuroimaging","Dissociative_Experiences_Scale","Depersonalization","Derealization","Psychogenic_amnesia","Dissociative_disorder","Psychological_trauma","Physical_abuse","Psychological_abuse","Child_sexual_abuse","Specificity_(tests)","Sensitivity_(tests)","Child_abuse","Posttraumatic_stress_disorder","Daniel_Schechter","Depersonalization","Psychological_numbing","Apathy","Self-esteem","Correlation","Psychoactive_drug","Ketamine","Nitrous_oxide","Alcohol","LSD","Tiletamine","Marijuana","Dextromethorphan","Phencyclidine","Methoxetamine","Salvia_divinorum","Muscimol","Atropine","Ibogaine","Altered_state_of_consciousness","Coping_(psychology)","Dissociative_disorder","Dissociative_Experiences_Scale","Dissociative_Identity_Disorder","Dissociative","Emotional_detachment","Fantasy_prone_personality","International_Society_for_the_Study_of_Trauma_and_Dissociation","Psychological_numbing","Repressed_memory","Splitting_(psychology)"]}
