{"cursor":"7119","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"'Isolation' is a defence mechanism in psychoanalytic theory first proposed by\nSigmund Freud. While related to repression the concept distinguishes itself in\nseveral ways. It is characterized as a mental process involving the creation of\na gap between an unpleasant or threatening cognition, and other thoughts and\nfeelings. By minimizing associative connections with other thoughts, the\nthreatening cognition is remembered less often and is less likely to affect self-\nesteem or the self concept. Freud illustrated the concept\nwith the example of a person beginning a train of thought and then pausing for a\nmoment before continuing to a different subject. His theory stated that by\ninserting an interval the person was \"letting it be understood symbolically that\nhe will not allow his thoughts about that impression or activity to come into\nassociative contact with other thoughts.â As a defense\nagainst harmful thoughts, isolation prevents the self from allowing these\ncognitions to become recurrent and possibly damaging to the self-concept.\n","linknr":264,"url":"Isolation_(psychology)","recorded":1362584972,"links":18,"instances":["psychology"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Psychological adjustment","Defence mechanisms","Emotions","Psychopathology"],"headings":["Evidence","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Plutchik-wheel.svg/90px-Plutchik-wheel.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","psychology"]],"members":["sublimation"],"related":["Defence_mechanism","Psychoanalytic_theory","Sigmund_Freud","Psychological_repression","Self-esteem","Self_concept","Denial","Sublimation_(psychology)","Psychological_projection"]}
