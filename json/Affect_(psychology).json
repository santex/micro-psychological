See\n[http://chiron.valdosta.edu/whuitt/col/affsys/affsys.html The Affective System]:\na webpage by Dr. William Huitt. Affect is a key part of the process of an\norganism's interaction with stimuli. The word also refers sometimes to affect\ndisplay, which is \"a facial, vocal, or gestural behavior that serves as an\nindicator of affect\" (APA 2006).\n\nThe affective domain represents one of the three divisions described in modern\npsychology: the cognitive, the conative, and the 'affective'. Classically, these\ndivisions have also been referred to as the \"ABC of psychology\", in that case\nusing the terms \"affect\", \"behavior\", and \"cognition\". In certain views, the\nconative may be considered as a part of the affective, or the affective as a\npart of the cognitive.\n","linknr":395,"url":"Affect_(psychology)","recorded":1362889827,"links":56,"instances":["psychology","psychology","psychology"],"pdf":["http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-2003.pdf","http://personality-project.org/revelle/publications/gilboa.pdf","https://www2.bc.edu/~russeljm/publications/Russell1980.pdf","http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/99/2/229.pdf"],"categories":["Feeling"],"headings":["Theoretical perspective","History","Psychometric measurement of affect","Non-conscious affect and perception","Arousal","Affect and mood","Social interaction","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Merge-arrows.svg/50px-Merge-arrows.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Psi2.svg/28px-Psi2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["stimulus","psychology"],["attitude","psychology"],["mood","psychology"]],"members":["mood","attitude","stimulus"],"related":["Experience","Feeling","Emotion","Organism","Stimulus_(psychology)","Affect_display","Psychology","Cognition","Conation","Behavior","Robert_B._Zajonc","Pleasure","Displeasure","Temperament","Socialization","Idiosyncrasies","Geography","Anthropology","Gilles_Deleuze","Non-representational_theory","Preferences","Attitude_(psychology)","Impression_formation","Decision_making","Recognition_memory","Cognitive","Zajonc","Arousal","Evolutionary_constraints","Physiological","Amygdala","Mood_(psychology)","Affect_measures","Mood_repair_strategies","Interpersonal_communication","Evolutionary_psychologist","Facial_expression","Gesture","Cultures","Gestures","Emotional_labor","Affect_theory","Affect_consciousness","Affect_heuristic","Affect_infusion_model","Affect_measures","Affective_science","Affective_neuroscience","Affective_spectrum","Emotion","Feeling","Negative_affectivity","Silvan_Tomkins","Social_neuroscience"]}
